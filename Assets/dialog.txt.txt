My wife was over in District 8 when this all started. I hope all this madness stop soon so I can go find her.
I used to be a blacksmith like you, but then I took a hammer to the knee....
My wife was killed in the Cataclysm....
Have you seen my wife?
Guten tag.
What're you looking at? This food is mine. Keep moving.
I lost everything.
Where'd you find that food?
Have any extra food?
This ash is making it difficult to get any water from the river.
My kids need food.  Can you spare any?
I can't find my son. Have you seen him?
I can't find my daughter. Have you seen her?
I didn't like working in the factory, but at least we had food then.
